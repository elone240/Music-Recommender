# Music-Recommender
Be Aware:
  Some code was copied from Moshfegh Hamedani's video on machine learning.
  
Info on the project:  
  The music reccomendar project doesnt actually use real data. 
  The data is made up, but if given real data (via CSV file), it could be able to reccomend music accurately.
  Also, if any person, was to open this project in the jupyter notebook (the editor used to create this project), it would easily be possible to convert the .ipynb files to .py files.
