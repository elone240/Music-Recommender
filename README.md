# Music-Recommender
Be Aware:
  Some code was copied from Moshfegh Hamedani's video on machine learning.
  
Info on the project:  
  The music reccomendar project doesnt actually use real data. 
  The data is made up, but if given real data (via CSV file), it could be able to reccomend music accurately.
